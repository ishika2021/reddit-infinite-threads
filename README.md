# Reddit Infinite Thread

This project aims to implement the infinite thread feature of Reddit using Vue 3. The project is only made for learning purposes.

## Demo 🚀
Go through the demo on [code-sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/ishika2021/reddit-infinite-threads/main?workspaceId=817d7477-1086-462f-90e3-8d0fd4ebafeb)

## Working 💻
1. Type in a comment and press enter to add it to the list of main threads.
2. To reply to a comment, click on the reply icon of that comment, which highlights the input box and adds the reply.
3. The up and down icons are used to handle votes on a particular thread.

## Implementation 📝
The project uses ` Vue's render function` to create the Comment component rather than the traditional templating used in Vue JS. The comment component is a `recursive component` that works efficiently for parent and child threads.
